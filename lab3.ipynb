    "## Theoretical Background: Meshes and Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Mesh?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 3D computer graphics, a **mesh** is a collection of vertices, edges, and faces that define the shape of a 3D object. It is the most common representation for rendering complex surfaces and models. Typically, faces are defined as **triangles** (or sometimes quadrilaterals), as triangles are simple, efficient, and always lie on a plane. A mesh can represent anything from basic geometric shapes (like cubes or spheres) to highly detailed scanned or simulated models.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mesh is made up of:\n",
    "- **Vertices**: Points in 3D space, each with an (x, y, z) coordinate.\n",
    "- **Indices**: Groups of vertex indices that form triangular faces.\n",
    "- **Topology**: The connectivity information that defines how triangles share edges and vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Attributes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes** are additional data values associated with the vertices or faces of a mesh. These attributes influence how the mesh is rendered, colored, and shaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of common attributes:\n",
    "- **Scalar attributes** (e.g., temperature, height, pressure) — typically used to generate color maps.\n",
    "- **Vector attributes** (e.g., normals, flow directions) — used for lighting and directional encoding.\n",
    "- **Face (triangle) attributes** — used to apply labels, regions, or segmentation colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes can be associated with:\n",
    "- **Vertices** (per-vertex): Smooth gradients and continuous color transitions.\n",
    "- **Faces** (per-face or per-triangle): Hard boundaries and discrete classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Attributes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes allow for **data-driven visualization**, enabling users to:\n",
    "- Visualize physical properties (height, stress, temperature).\n",
    "- Add surface details without modifying geometry.\n",
    "- Encode categories or segmentation labels for analysis.\n",
    "- Simulate realistic lighting using surface normals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, meshes define the **geometry** of 3D objects, while attributes define their **appearance and meaning**. By combining geometry with scalar or vector attributes, we unlock powerful visualization capabilities — from scientific simulations and medical imaging to game graphics and 3D modeling.\n"

    "## Example 1. Creating a Simple Colored Triangle Mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple colored triangle mesh is the foundational building block in 3D graphics. It involves defining a set of vertices (points in 3D space) and connecting them using indices to form triangular faces. Each triangle is rendered by connecting three vertices, and together they can represent complex shapes. In this example, a square surface is created by defining four vertices and connecting them with two triangles. The mesh is then rendered using a uniform color, which gives it a flat, consistent appearance. This approach helps students understand the core structure of mesh data — vertex positions and triangle connectivity — and how it is used to define and visualize 3D surfaces.\n",

    "Per-vertex scalar attributes allow us to enhance mesh visualizations by encoding data directly onto the surface. Instead of displaying a uniform color, we assign a scalar value to each vertex — for example, the Z-coordinate representing height — and use it to generate a color map. This technique creates a gradient effect across the mesh, visually representing changes in elevation, intensity, or other scalar fields. In practice, this method is widely used in scientific and engineering applications to display terrain height, temperature, pressure, or other measurements over a 3D surface. By mapping these attributes to colors, we gain a more informative and intuitive understanding of the underlying data.\n",

    "Per-triangle coloring is a technique in mesh visualization where each triangular face is assigned a distinct color, rather than interpolating colors across vertices. This approach is useful for highlighting discrete regions, classifications, or categorical differences within a mesh. Unlike per-vertex coloring, which creates smooth transitions, per-triangle coloring results in sharp color boundaries that clearly delineate individual faces. It is particularly effective in applications such as segmentation maps, finite element analysis, and mesh debugging, where it is important to visually distinguish between separate elements or regions. In practice, this is achieved by assigning a scalar or label to each triangle and mapping it to a specific color using a color map.\n",

    "Coloring a mesh based on the distance of each vertex from a central point creates a visually intuitive radial gradient, which can highlight spatial relationships and symmetry within the geometry. In this example, the Euclidean distance from the origin (or any defined center) is computed for each vertex and used as a scalar attribute to determine color. The result is a smooth transition of color from the center outward, emphasizing depth, distance, or influence zones. This technique is especially useful in visualizing heatmaps, radial fields, proximity effects, or attention zones in simulations, user interaction models, or environmental analyses.\n",

This approach is highly efficient and visually expressive, allowing for localized color control without complex shading or texture mapping. Per-vertex coloring is widely used in scientific visualization, modeling, and interactive graphics to represent data variation or region segmentation across a mesh.\n"

    "### Task 5: Build a Mesh with a Central Peak and Visual Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a radial mesh with a central peak and visualize a smooth color gradient from center to edges based on distance.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- Create a grid of (x, y) values from -1 to 1.\n",
    "- Define Z as a Gaussian bump (e.g., Z = exp(-r^2), where r = sqrt(x² + y²)).\n",
    "- Stack the coordinates into a vertex array.\n",
    "- Build triangle indices for the grid.\n",
    "- Calculate distances from center and convert them into a smooth color gradient.\n",
    "- Use colors= in k3d.mesh to apply the coloring.\n",
    "\n",
    "As outcome you should obtain a visually appealing 3D bump mesh with color radiating from the center outward, illustrating distance-based coloring."
